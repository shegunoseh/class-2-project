09/02/2018, 19:41,Brown QA," An old church, in a village in Brazil, was leaking and the walls were almost collapsing. After service, the Padre asked the worshipers if they could organize a fundraising to rebuild the church... He told them to contribute whatever God has blessed each and everyone of them with. If you have some money, you can bring the money, if you earn a living by selling tomatoes in the market, you can bring the tomatoes, and they get auctioned to raise the money. If you operate a hardware store, it would be even better, you can bring some nails and iron sheets for the roof; whatever you have. Eventually, it was fundraising day, and worshippers came out in large numbers, some with money in their pockets, others with goods, depending on their jobs and sources of livelihood. They were met by a strange sight: a coffin at the entrance of the church!..."
